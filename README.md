#ATM Management System
Developed a comprehensive ATM Management System that allows users to securely log in, perform transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks, 
and view transaction history. The system integrates Java for backend logic, PL/SQL for database operations, and JSP for the user interface. It interacts with a 
MySQL database to manage user information, account balances, and transaction details, ensuring efficient and secure handling of banking operations.

Secure Login: User authentication with username and PIN for access control.
Transaction Handling: Withdrawal, deposit, and balance check functionalities with real-time database updates.
Transaction History: Tracks and displays the user's transaction history.
Database Integration: Uses MySQL for storing user accounts, balances, and transactions, with PL/SQL for efficient querying and transaction management.
